## 🚀 Inspiration

Students and developers often struggle to find authentic competitions and hackathons scattered across multiple platforms.

We wanted to build a **single hub** where users can:

- Discover opportunities easily  
- Save time searching  
- Participate faster  
- Track everything from one dashboard  

LOSERS was created to simplify this journey.
